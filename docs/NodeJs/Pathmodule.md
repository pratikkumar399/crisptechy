In Node.js, the `path` module is a core module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It helps in constructing, manipulating, and resolving file paths in a platform-independent manner. The `path` module is useful for tasks such as joining path segments, resolving relative paths, and extracting information from file paths. Here are some common functionalities provided by the `path` module:

1. **Joining Path Segments**: The `path.join()` method is used to concatenate multiple path segments into a single path.

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   const filePath = path.join('/myDir', 'subDir', 'file.txt');
   console.log(filePath); // Returns '/myDir/subDir/file.txt'
   ```

2. **Resolving Absolute Path**: The `path.resolve()` method resolves an absolute path by resolving relative paths against the current working directory.

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   const absolutePath = path.resolve('myDir', 'subDir', 'file.txt');
   console.log(absolutePath); // Returns '/current/working/directory/myDir/subDir/file.txt'
   ```

3. **Extracting Path Components**: The `path.basename()` method returns the last portion of a path, and `path.dirname()` method returns the directory name of a path.

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   const filePath = '/myDir/subDir/file.txt';
   console.log(path.basename(filePath)); // Returns 'file.txt'
   console.log(path.dirname(filePath)); // Returns '/myDir/subDir'
   ```

4. **Extracting File Extension**: The `path.extname()` method returns the file extension of a path.

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   const filePath = '/myDir/subDir/file.txt';
   console.log(path.extname(filePath)); // Returns '.txt'
   ```

5. **Platform-Specific Path Separator**: The `path.sep` property provides the platform-specific path segment separator (`/` on Unix-like systems, `\` on Windows).

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   console.log(path.sep); // Returns '/' on Unix-like systems, '\' on Windows
   ```

6. **Normalizing Path**: The `path.normalize()` method normalizes a path by resolving `.` and `..` segments.

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   const normalizedPath = path.normalize('/myDir/../subDir/./file.txt');
   console.log(normalizedPath); // Returns '/subDir/file.txt'
   ```

These are some of the common functionalities provided by the `path` module in Node.js. The `path` module offers additional methods and properties that can be used for various file path operations, making it easier to work with file paths in a cross-platform manner.
