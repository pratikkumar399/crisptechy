#### `02. Explain the main functions of an operating system.`

Operating system performs the following functions: 


<u>1. Process Manangement :</u> 

* **Task Scheduling**: The OS decides which processes should run and when, managing the execution order to optimize CPU usage.
* **Creation and Termination**: The OS creates, terminates, and manages processes, including allocating resources and maintaining the process life cycle.

<u> 2. Memory management: </u>

* **Memory Allocation**: The OS allocates memory to processes and programs, ensuring that each process has enough memory to execute.
* **Virtual Memory**: The OS creates the illusion of having more memory than the system actually has, by using disk space to simulate RAM.

<u> 3. File System Management: </u>

* **File Creation and Deletion**: The OS creates and deletes files and directories, and manages the file system structure.
* **File Access Control**: Manages permissions and access control to ensure the security and integrity of files and data.
